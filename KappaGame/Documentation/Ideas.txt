This file documents the ideas from the Twitch stream that took place on February 6, 2016 at twitch.tv/Quentillionaire

The following are brainstorms for our 2D MOBA:

3 vertical "lanes" for level design
how to generate lanes: 
	Static lanes (HotS, DOTA, LoL)
	PCG procedurally:
		Mirror
		Math to ensure to unfair advantage

Jungles:
	Series of ethereal platforms (perform action to enter)
	seperate lanes
	PCG again, x units away from center, path through jungle pivots to create jungles
	Include Jungle buffs
	2.5D - Jungles are separate rooms
	Jungle appears behind main arena, slightly blurred

Setting for the game:
	possible hero/champion/whatever classes:
		witches
		steampunk
		magic
		knight
		futuristic
	Contra/Metal Slug feel?

Shop:
	buy talents, not items

Skill:
	Where do these go? QER? 1234?
	Active abilities

Talents?:
	important changes that act passively throughout the game
	ie:
		health/magic/stat boosts

Weapons:
	Base weapon can be interchangeable
	Different weapons have different attack types

Characters:
	Character choice affects skill types

Misc:
	Player collisions:
		Collide with players and enemies
		Teammate "Boosting"

Authentication:
	Use twitch accounts!
