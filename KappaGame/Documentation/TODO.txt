	Best if it could abstract the actual pixels out, and arrange data near center of screen
	implements "safe zone", or buffer of n pixels from edge of screen

	Random terrain, build using a pathing algorithm
	Should go through base point, jungle start point, and mid point
	mirrored over center (Try without, but balance lengths)

	Packets, packet types, reading, sending, etc.
	No interaction with Matchmaking API //yet//.
